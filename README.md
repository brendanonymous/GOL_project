# Conway's Game of Life
This is a project I did for my Parallel Computing class (CptS 411) at WSU Pullman.
It is meant to be run on a Unix-type OS.
I used C and Message Passing Interface (MPI) to pass information amid the Pleiades cluster remotely located at WSU Tricity.
The Pleiades cluster is an 8-node, 64-core cluster.
Each node has 8 Intel Xeon cores and 4GB of shared RAM.
